#Required for some applications. Set to 1 to turn on.
#At one point we needed this enabled (1) for some web browsers to function properly.
#As of 2022, it looks like Brave/Ungoogled Chromium will work fine with this disabled
#However, programs like Zoom need this enabled. If you use Zoom often, set it to 1, otherwise you can run the below to manually enable it one time:
#sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1

#Disabling this is much safer and good for security. Only turn this to 1 if you get an error or warning.
kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 0
